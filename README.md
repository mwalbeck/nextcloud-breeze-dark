If you have any questions, problems or any thing else you're welcome to come hangout in the dedicated matrix room: #nextcloud-breeze-dark:mwalbeck.org

## Supported versions

The currently supported and maintained Nextcloud releases are:

-   Nextcloud 21
-   Nextcloud 20

I try my best to maintain 2 Nextcloud releases at once, to allow for smoother transistions, but for various reason I might decide to drop support for older releases early.

Previous unmaintained releases:

-   Nextcloud 19
-   Nextcloud 18
-   Nextcloud 17
-   Nextcloud 11-16

## Version number

The first number is the Nextcloud version. The second number is the Nextcloud major point release version. The third number is the theme version.

## Installation

It's available in the [Nextcloud app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/breezedark), just search for Breeze Dark, or look under customizations.

or you can clone this repo into your app folder and enable it in the app menu in Nextcloud.

## Usage

After you install the theme, you need to enable it. There a 2 options for this, a global and a personal one.

### Global

The global option enables the theme by default for all users and unauthenticated visits. Without this option stuff like the login and sharing pages won't be styled. There is also an option to exclude the login page from being themed while the rest is. You can find the global options here:

```
Admin settings > Theming > Breeze Dark
```

Please note that you need the Theming app enabled in Nextcloud to access the global settings.

### Personal

The personal option allows each user to set their own preference independent of how you set the global option. If the user hasn't set an option yet, they will follow the global option. You can find the personal option here:

```
Personal settings > Accessibility > Breeze Dark
```

Please note that you need the Accessibility app enabled in Nextcloud to access the personal setting.

### Custom styling

Under the Theming section in the admin settings you can add your own custom styling to the theme. Only standard CSS can be used. This custom styling will be applied whenever the theme is enabled and only affects the Breeze Dark theme.

## Known issues

### Login image not shown when theme is enabled

This is caused by the way this theme accesses custom login images. There are 2 workarounds to fix the issue:

#### First workaround (recommended)

Switch to using pretty urls. Pretty urls are urls where the index.php isn't present. For apache you can follow [these steps](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#pretty-urls) from the documentation and for Nginx I recommend having a look at the [example config](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/nginx.html) from the documentation

#### Second workaround

You can use the custom styling functionality and add the following CSS rule

```
body#body-login {
	background-image: url('../../../index.php/apps/theming/image/background'), url('../../../core/img/background.png');
}
```

## Contributions

### Issues

If you find an issue with the theme I would grealy appreciate it if you opened a bug report, so it can be fixed.

You're also very welcome to open a styling request, if there is an app you would like to see supported by this theme.

A full list of supported apps can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/mwalbeck/nextcloud-breeze-dark/wiki/Styled-apps).

### Pull requests

If you would like to contribute to the theme, all you need is a working Nextcloud setup and a text editor. Nextcloud is going to handle all the sass compilation on it's own. When you have you have Nextcloud setup, you can simply clone this repo into the app folder.

As nextcloud caches all sass, your changes won't show up immediately. To have your changes show up an easy trick is to disable the theme, refresh the page and then enable it again. This isn't perfect, but works most of time. If your changes don't show up, you can either wait a couple of minutes and then try again, or you can try running an **occ maintenance:repair**.

You're always welcome to open an issue and talk about the changes, you would like to make, before starting.
