## Contributions

### Issues
If you find an issue with the theme I would grealy appreciate it if you opened a bug report, so it can be fixed.

You're also very welcome to open a styling request, if there is an app you would like to see supported by this theme.

A full list of supported apps can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/mwalbeck/nextcloud-breeze-dark/wiki/Styled-apps).

### Pull requests
If you would like to contribute to the theme, all you need is a working Nextcloud setup and a text editor. Nextcloud is going to handle all the sass compilation on it's own. When you have you have Nextcloud setup, you can simply clone this repo into the app folder.

As nextcloud caches all sass, your changes won't show up immediately. To have your changes show up an easy trick is to disable the theme, refresh the page and then enable it again. This isn't perfect, but works most of time. If your changes don't show up, you can either wait a couple of minutes and then try again, or you can try running an **occ maintenance:repair**.

You're always welcome to open an issue and talk about the changes, you would like to make, before starting.
