# Nextcloud Breeze Dark Theme
This is a Breeze Dark Theme for Nextcloud

## Progress
Theming for Core Nextcloud functionality is done. You can check on the progress of App styling and request styling for specific apps [here](https://github.com/mwalbeck/nextcloud-breeze-dark/issues/2)

## Installation
The master branch will always be the current stable release so you can clone that for easy installation and updates.

You can also download it as a zip file and extract it to your themes folder.

To enable the theme, add or change the theme option in your config.php to:

    'theme' => 'nextcloud-breeze-dark',

## Contributions

The theme is written with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

If you would like to contribute please make your pull requests to the **develop** branch.

You can find the colours and their variable names in _colours.scss. Any changes to icons should go in the _icons.scss. Changes to Nextcloud core should go in styles.scss. For new apps please place the styling in a new file called _APPNAME.scss and import it at the bottom of style.scss.

If you would like to contribute with styling for an app not currently styled, then please open a new issue.
